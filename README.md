# APNGEditorWeb
This is a web version of an app I had made a couple of years ago for personal use, I might implement new functionalities as I need them or if they get requested

## Requirements
- `git`
- `npm`

## Install
First of all, you must clone the repo and install the packages:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/G1org1owo/apng-editor-web APNGEditorWeb
$ cd APNGEditorWeb
$ npm install
```
Then you have to build the source code:
```bash
$ npm run build
```
After this, you can run the app:
```bash
$ npm run preview
```

Alternatively, if you want to make some changes to the source code, you might want to run the app with quick-reload enabled:
```bash
$ npm run dev
```
